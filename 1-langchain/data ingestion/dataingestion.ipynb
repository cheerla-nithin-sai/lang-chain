The accuracy and efficiency of AI-driven trading systems have outpaced traditional methods, enabling the identification of profitable opportunities with minimal human intervention.\\n\\nThese AI systems use machine learning models, such as neural networks and decision trees, to process and interpret complex datasets. By continuously learning from past performance and adapting to new information, AI can predict price movements, assess risks, and optimize trading strategies. Natural language processing (NLP) is another crucial component of AI in stock trading, enabling systems to analyze news articles, social media sentiment, and financial reports to gauge market sentiment and potential impacts on stock prices. This ability to process unstructured data has given traders a competitive edge, as they can respond to market changes more swiftly and accurately.\\n\\nHowever, the adoption of AI in stock trading is not without challenges. The reliance on algorithms can lead to unforeseen market volatility, especially when multiple AI systems simultaneously execute trades based on similar data patterns. Moreover, the black-box nature of some AI models makes it difficult for traders to understand the reasoning behind specific trading decisions, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the benefits of AI in stock trading are undeniable. As technology continues to advance, AI-driven trading systems are expected to become even more sophisticated, further transforming the financial markets.

INTRODUCTION\\nBeginning in the 1990s with introduction of computational\\nmethods in ﬁnance, much research has focused on applying\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to ﬁnancial investments in the\\nstock market. The main advantages of using computational\\napproaches to automate the ﬁnancial investment process in-\\nclude the elimination of \"momentary irrationality\" or de-\\ncisions made based on emotions, ability to recognize and\\nexplore patterns that are looked over by humans, and imme-\\ndiate consumption of information in real-time. This area of\\nknowledge has become known as Computational Finance.\\nMore recently, within computational ﬁnance, there is in-\\ncreasing use of and research on AI techniques applied in\\nﬁnancial investments. Although a computer conducts the vast\\nmajority of hedge fund trades in an automated way, 90% of\\nthese operations are still performed by a hardcoded proce-\\ndure [12]. Thus, the ever-increasing application of artiﬁcial\\nintelligence still has great potential for development.\\nGenerally, AI is applied to ﬁnance in three different areas:\\nthe optimization of ﬁnancial portfolios, prediction of future\\nprices or trends in ﬁnancial assets, and sentiment analysis ofnews or social media comments about the assets or compa-\\nnies. Despite the differences and peculiarities of each area,\\nsome works have proposed combinations of techniques from\\nthe different areas. Some other studies in the area of computa-\\ntional ﬁnance include the control of dynamic systems applied\\nto the ﬁnancial market [8], investor behavioral analysis [77],\\nnetwork analysis [37], [82] and clustering of ﬁnancial assets\\n[1]. [98] relates the calibrated volatility of options to the\\nmovements in futures prices in the Taiwan stock market. It\\ncalculates a correlation of approximately -0.9 and concludes\\nthat the volatility of options can be used for the prediction of\\nfutures prices.\\nThe presented work analyzes the development of each of\\nthese areas from its initiation to its state-of-the-art advance-\\nments. For this, a sample of works on artiﬁcial intelligence\\npublished between 1995-2019 was collected for detailed\\nanalysis and comparison.\\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section II presents\\nsome general information extracted from the works on the\\napplication of AI to ﬁnance.

OVERVIEW\\nThe analysis of the works that deal with the application of\\nartiﬁcial intelligence to ﬁnancial investments is based on a\\nsample of works taken from Scopus. The query, performed on\\nMay 27, 2020, returned a total of 2326 documents, including\\njournal and conference papers published between 1995 and\\n2019.\\nTable 1 presents the most cited papers on Artiﬁcial In-\\ntelligence applied to ﬁnancial investments. The oldest paper\\nis from 2000 [13], and the most recent is from 2015 [63].\\nTherefore, it can be observed that this is a relatively new\\nresearch area that is gaining increasing attention. Among\\nthe papers showed in Table 1, there are no more recent\\ndocuments than 2015 as expected since they had less time\\nto be studied by other researchers, and newer papers tend to\\nbe more speciﬁc.\\nTABLE 1.

As a forecast, the risk is the\\nproposed metric to model the return’s uncertainty.\\nThe Markowitz model considers the portions of an in-\\nvestor‘s total budget invested in each asset. Considering n\\navailable assets, xj(j∈{1,...,n}) is the proportion of the\\ntotal capital invested in the asset j. Thus, there is a constraint\\nthat ensures that the sum of investments must be equal to\\nthe capital available for investment, or∑n\\nj=1xj= 1. In the\\ninitial model, short selling was not allowed and, therefore,\\nxj≥0,∀j∈{1,...,n}.\\nThe aforementioned model uses a random variable Rj,\\nwhose average is equal to µj=E(Rj), whereE(R)is\\na function that returns the expected value of the random\\nvariableR. This random variable is composed of Tdifferent\\nscenarios, in which each scenario t(t= 1,...,T ) occurs with\\na probability pt, so that∑T\\nt=1pt= 1. In each scenario Rj\\nassumes a value equal to rjt. Thus, the expected value for\\nRjcan be determined by: µj=∑T\\nt=1ptrjt. In practice,\\nthe historical series of rates of return of an asset represents\\nits scenarios. Considering that each scenario occurs with the\\nsame probability, the expected return value of an asset jcan\\nbe deﬁned as follows:\\nµj=1\\nT−1T∑\\nt=2rjtwherert\\njis the rate of return of the asset jin the period\\nbetweent−1andtof a historical series consisting of T\\nquotations of j. Thus, the return RXof a portfolio Xis the\\nweighted average of the returns of the assets that comprise\\nX, that isRX=∑n\\nj=1Rjxj, and the expected return of X\\ncan be calculated as follows:\\nµ(X) =E(RX) =E(n∑\\nj=1Rjxj) =n∑\\nj=1µjxj. (1)\\nThe greatest contribution of the Markowitz model, how-\\never, is the introduction to the concept of portfolio risk,\\ndeﬁned in its model as the variance of a portfolio’s historical\\nreturns concerning its expected value:\\nσ2(RX) =E{(RX−E(RX))2}.\\nThe portfolio variance is deﬁned based on the pairwise\\ncorrelation values of the returns of the assets that compose\\nit. Therefore, the diversity of the portfolio tends to reduce its\\nrisk [54]. This variance of the portfolio Xcan be written as\\nfollows:\\nσ2(X) =n∑\\ni=1n∑\\nj=1σijxixj.\\nFinally, the classic Markowitz model for portfolio opti-\\nmization is:\\nVOLUME 4, 2016 5'),\n",

The use\\nof portfolio variance as a risk measure, for example, has been\\nwidely criticized since the variance takes into account both\\nnegative and positive deviations. Then, downside risk mea-\\nsures emerged, taking into account only the worst historical\\nreturns of the portfolios. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is\\na downside risk measure widely used because it is a coherent\\nmeasure [68]. The CVaR (F ) function is given by [69]:\\nFα(X,ζ ) =ζ+1\\n(1−α)T∑\\nt=1pt[n∑\\nj=1−(rjtxj)−ζ]+,\\nwhereptis the probability of scenario tto occur,αis the\\nconﬁdence level, and ζis the VaR αvalue, which is the α-\\nquantile of the portfolio losses.\\nNumerous works have improved these models, creating\\nmore risk measures and proposing restrictions that bring\\nthem closer to the practical aspects of stock market trading.\\nSeveral exact, heuristic and hybrid optimization methods\\nhave been proposed to solve these portfolio optimization\\nmodels, which have become increasingly more complex.\\nLimiting search on Scopus to papers on portfolio optimiza-\\ntion, 693 documents were found. Table 4 shows the most\\ncited portfolio optimization papers by year.\\nMoreover, a portfolio optimization Mean-Absolute De-\\nviation (MAD) model was proposed with the objective to\\nminimize the absolute deviation (risk measure) [79]. The\\nexpected return is the mean return of a historical series,\\nand the minimum return constraint deﬁnes its lower bound.\\nThe model also considers a cardinality restriction limiting\\nthe number of assets of the portfolio to an upper bound.\\nTransaction lots constraint ensures that some of the assets can\\nonly be traded in an amount that is a multiple of a minimum\\nquantity of shares. The paper employed a hybrid method,\\nwhich applies a proposed heuristic that ﬁnds good weights\\nfor assets after an exact method solves the linear relaxed\\nproblem.\\nIn [52], a Mean Semi-Absolute Deviation model aimed to\\nminimize the semi-absolute deviation as the risk measure,\\nand the mean return is constrained to a lower bound value.\\nThe model also considered the transaction lots constraint, andTABLE 4.

The\\nwork considered cardinality, transaction lots, and turnover\\nconstraints, and found that these methods can be solved by\\nseveral Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs).\\nFinally, the paper compares the models mentioned above\\nto a monobjective Sharpe-ratio model solved by a Genetic\\nAlgorithm.\\n[53] reviewed monobjectives and biobjectives portfolio\\noptimization methods, which aim to minimize risk, subject\\nto a minimum mean return value, and to minimize risk\\nand maximize mean return, respectively. The considered risk\\nmeasures include absolute deviation, minimum return, Gini’s\\nMean Difference (GMD), and Conditional Value-at-Risk\\n(CVaR). The paper analyzed transaction costs, cardinality,\\nand transaction lots constraints. The methods reviewed can\\nbe divided into heuristics: Non-dominated Sorting GeneticAlgorithm II (NSGA-II), Pareto Envelope-based Selection\\nAlgorithm (PESA) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algo-\\nrithm 2 (SPEA2) for multiobjective models, and Genetic Al-\\ngorithm (GA) and Threshold Accepting (TA) for the monob-\\njective ones; and exacts: branch-and-bound and branch-and-\\ncut based methods; and hybrids: methods in which heuristics\\nﬁnd a good relatively small subset of assets before exact\\nalgorithms ﬁnd optimum solutions for these subsets.\\nAnother trend that was subsequently observed is the use of\\nmultiobjective models, since the choice of prioritizing return\\nor risk depends on the proﬁle of a particular investor.

The utility function combines the random fuzzy\\nvariable variance (risk measure) minimization and its mean\\n(expected return) maximization.

These characteristics are the\\nnumber of objectives for the proposed or studied models in\\neach paper (some of them consider multiple models with\\ndifferent numbers of objectives, such as [65]), the presence of\\nweight factors, which apply weights for different objectives\\nsummed in one single objective (x indicates the presence of\\nthis characteristic), the use of fuzzy variables in the model,\\nthe use of skewness or diversiﬁcation of the historical series\\nto evaluate the portfolio.\\nAs portfolio risks can be measured in several different\\nways, Table 6 presents the risks measures considered in each\\npaper, where evaluated models that consider multiple risk\\nmeasures, while others analyze various models with different\\nrisk measures. In this table, V stands for the Variance risk\\nmeasure, SV for Semi Variance, AD for Absolute Deviation,\\nSAD for Semi Absolute Deviation, VaR for Value-at-Risk,\\nCVaR for Conditional Value-at-Risk, MR for Minimum Re-\\nturn, and GMD for Gini‘s Mean Difference.\\nIn addition to the objectives, which are usually risks and\\nreturns, portfolio optimization models are also characterized\\nby their constraints. Table 7 presents the constraints used in\\nthe models of each paper. The main constraints are:\\n•Minimum return constraint deﬁnes a lower limit for the\\nportfolio’s expected return.\\n•Transaction lots constraint ensures that the capital in-\\nvested in a given asset is a multiple of a minimum\\nnumber of shares.\\n•Cardinality constraint limits the number of assets that\\ncan make up the portfolio. Fixed cardinality constraint\\nallows only one cardinality value for the portfolio, while\\nvariable cardinality constraint enables a range of integer\\nvalues for the number of assets in the portfolio.\\n•Transaction costs are related to the trade of assets in\\nthe Stock Market. Some portfolio optimization models\\nconsider the constraint that ensures that the total cost of\\nthe portfolio, including transaction costs, cannot exceed\\nthe capital available for investment.\\n•Turnover constraint is used in multi-period optimiza-\\ntion, and for each period, it deﬁnes the cost of a new\\nportfolio based on an existing current portfolio.\\nOptimization methods can be heuristic, exact, or hybrid\\nwhen both are used. There is still the possibility of using Ma-chine Learning (ML) algorithms to assist in the optimization\\nprocess. Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) a posteriori\\nmethods are often used for multiobjective problems when the\\nselection of only one solution is required. So, Table 8 presents\\nthe types of methods performed in each paper.\\nPortfolio optimization models are becoming increasingly\\ncomplex, presenting more restrictions and, in some cases,\\nseveral objectives. This way, there is a tendency to use heuris-\\ntics to solve them since exact methods cannot solve some\\nmore complex models in polynomial time. A more signiﬁcant\\nnumber of objectives stems from the growing number of\\nmetrics proposed to represent the return and, principally, the\\nrisk of a ﬁnancial portfolio.\\nIV. STOCK MARKET PREDICTION USING ARTIFICIAL\\nINTELLIGENCE\\nStock market prediction or forecasting using historical time\\nseries has become a technique widely used by researchers\\nand investors to obtain ﬁnancial proﬁts in stock trading.\\nThese predictions, initially carried out by statistical methods,\\nhave been increasingly performed by Artiﬁcial Intelligence\\nalgorithms. Therefore, AI applied to investments constitutes\\na recent research area that has already achieved a large\\namount of publications.\\nSince 1965, many researchers have defended the hypoth-\\nesis of an efﬁcient market [50], which states that the market\\nincorporates all the information that all market participants\\nhave and their expectations, so that the price changes are\\ncompletely random and unpredictable.\\nIn contrast to the efﬁcient market hypothesis, other re-\\nsearchers believe that the market prices ﬂuctuate with a trend.\\nConsidering this hypothesis, two schools of market analysis\\ncan be regarded as: 1) technical analysis, which defends\\ntrends in stock price movements and tries to predict them\\nthrough historical asset prices; and 2) fundamental analysis,\\nwhich argues that the socioeconomic context of a company\\ninterferes with its future stock price and, therefore, provides\\ninformation that can be used for forecasting future asset\\nprices [58].\\nThe general framework for an Artiﬁcial Intelligence pre-\\ndiction model applied to ﬁnancial forecasting is presented in\\nFigure 6. The ﬁrst step is the acquisition of all the necessary\\ndata to train and test the predictive model. These data can be\\ntreated, transformed, or reduced to remove noisy information\\nand highlight important information. Then, the predictor uses\\nthe treated data to train its model, in which its hyperparame-\\nters can be optimized in a validation step. Finally, the trained\\nmodel’s performance with tuned hyperparameters needs to be\\nevaluated in a test step.\\nLimiting search on Scopus to papers on Stock Market\\nforecasts using Machine Learning, 1719 documents were\\nfound. Table 9 shows the most cited articles that predict stock\\nmarket prices or trends using Artiﬁcial Intelligence by year.\\n[28] proposes a Rough Set Theory method that gener-\\nates rules to assist in Stock Market trading actions, which\\nincludes buying, selling, and keeping an asset.

A Self-\\norganization Map (SOM) neural network was used to divide\\nthe training data into clusters, and a fuzzy genetic system\\nwas applied to predict assets future prices. [32] proposed a\\nSelf-Organizing Map (SOM) combined with Genetic Pro-\\ngramming (GP) method. SOM divides training data into\\nseveral clusters, where each cluster is composed of training,\\nvalidation, and test data. Validation data select the best GP\\nmodel for that cluster, and test data evaluate the prediction\\nperformance. Prices, volume, and technical indicators areused as input data, and the model predicts the future prices\\nof assets.\\n[3] proposed the Preprocessed Evolutionary LM Neu-\\nral Networks (PELMNN). Step-wise Regression Analysis\\n(SRA) for variable selection. A genetic algorithm was used\\nas a global search method to evolve artiﬁcial neural networks\\ninitial weights, and a Levenberg–Marquardt Back Propaga-\\ntion (LMBP) neural network was trained and used to predict\\nfuture prices. The input data are technical indices and trading\\nvolume. [33] proposed a price forecasting method to perform\\nan iterative feature selection procedure using a backpropa-\\ngation neural network invalidation data composed of prices,\\nvolume, and technical indicators. Finally, a backpropagation\\nneural network was performed on test data to predict the\\nfuture prices of assets.\\n[10] selected prices and technical indicators data in a\\nbackward elimination method using a Random Forest al-\\ngorithm. Multiple Random Forest algorithms were used to\\npredict asset’s future prices. Final prediction used an aver-\\nage of the predictions of all the Random Forest predictors\\nweighted by their training error. [63] compared ANN, SVM,\\nrandom forest, and Naive-Bayes algorithms in performing\\nbinary classiﬁcation of assets prices trends. The classiﬁers\\nare fed by technical indicators data, and a validation step opti-\\nmizes the classiﬁers’ hyper-parameters. [11] surveyed Stock\\nMarket forecasting Machine Learning models. The paper ﬁrst\\nsurveys the preprocessing techniques: normalization, outliers\\nexclusion, clustering, and feature selection. The considered\\nforecasting models are the Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN)\\nand Support Vector Machine and ensembles methods that\\ncombine both and integrate the models mentioned above with\\nheuristics to predict assets future prices or price trends.\\n[17] compares three different feature selection and trans-\\nformation methods: Principal Components Analysis (PCA),\\nAutoEncoder (AE), and the Restricted Boltzmann Machine\\n(RBM). Then, a Machine Learning algorithm is performed\\nto predict future asset return. For this, log returns data are\\ncollected every ﬁve minutes. [26] uses a Deep Learning Long\\nShort Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for a binary\\nassets prices trend classiﬁcation, analyzing a historical series\\nof assets return. [51] proposes a Deep learning model with\\nconvolutional and recurrent neurons layers which classiﬁes\\nfuture assets price trends in three different classes, using\\nprices and volume historical data as input.\\nA trend that has been increasingly explored is the use of\\ncomplex techniques for preprocessing the input data, which\\nfacilitates the execution of Machine Learning algorithms\\nand increases its accuracy, since the noisy data tend to be\\neliminated, leaving only the most relevant data.\\nRecently, there has been an increasing tendency to ap-\\nply deep neural networks for stock market forecasting.

Compared to an\\nArtiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), results show that, although\\nthe DNN presents higher accuracy, the ANN provides greater\\nreturns and lower risks (variance) in a Stock Market trading\\nsimulation. [85] collected open, close, low, and high prices of\\nYahoo and Microsoft assets from January 2011 to December\\n2015 and computed ﬁve technical indicators as features: mo-\\nmentum, volatility, index momentum, index volatility, stock\\nmomentum, stock price volatility. The paper further com-\\npares the SVM and LSTM models for the problem of binary\\nclassiﬁcation of stock trends, and the results indicate the\\nbetter accuracy of the LSTM algorithm. [59] computed ten\\ntechnical indicators from opening, close, low. The high prices\\nof assets during November 2009 to November 2019 were\\nused to predict prices by applying Decision Tree, Bagging,\\nRandom Forest, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost,\\nArtiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network\\n(RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms,\\nconcluding that the LSTM algorithm performs better than the\\nothers.\\n[97] proposes a new two-dimensional CNN, which uses a\\nmatrix composed of futures, options, opening, closing, high\\nand low prices, and the transaction volume of each asset in a\\ntime series of 120 days of data. For that purpose, 5 Taiwanese\\nassets and 5 United States assets are used. The proposed\\nCNN is used to predict trends in the movement of ﬁnancial\\nasset prices. It considers three different classes: class 1, for\\ndays when the return exceeds 1%(upward trend),−1, for\\ndays when the return is less than −1% (downward trend) and\\n0, otherwise (lateral movement). The accuracy of the novel\\nclassiﬁer is compared to that of SVM, Neural Network and\\none-dimensional CNN and the results show that the novel\\nCNN surpasses all other classiﬁers considering each of the\\n10 assets.\\nTable 10 describes the input used by each paper col-\\nlected on Scopus.

Regression techniques are commonly\\nused to price prediction, while classiﬁcation techniques are\\nfrequently used to predict trends in asset price movements.\\nAn increasing amount of data used as inputs or features\\nwas identiﬁed, which implies the need to use methods to\\nselect and preprocess this input data to ﬁlter only the most\\nessential information. Deep Learning methods are another\\ntrend showing promising results in recent works, despite its\\ngreat computational complexity, which makes selecting and\\npreprocessing data even more important.\\nV. FINANCIAL SENTIMENT ANALYSIS\\nSentiment analysis is the ﬁeld of study that analyzes people’s\\nfeelings and moods towards an entity, such as a product to\\nevaluate whether the opinions are negative or positive and\\nhow negative or positive they are. To perform sentiment\\nanalysis, it is ﬁrst necessary to collect a large number of\\ntexts, such as those extracted from social media or news\\nwebsites, written in a natural language. Thus, the application\\nof natural language processing methods is also necessary\\n[49]. Sentiment analysis has been increasingly applied in\\nseveral areas of knowledge, such as computational ﬁnance.\\nIn ﬁnance, several researchers test the effect of news\\nand opinions on future asset prices, putting in check the\\nhypothesis of the efﬁcient market, based on the idea that news\\nand opinions guide investors, creating trends in market prices\\nand, thus, providing possibilities for an investor to obtain\\nproﬁts in stock market tradings.\\nLimiting the search on Scopus to papers on ﬁnancial\\nsentiment analysis, 289 documents were found. The most\\ncited sentiment analysis papers by year are present in Table\\n13.\\n[55] collected press related to stocks in NYSE or\\nNASDAQ-AMEX, considering only press releases of com-\\npanies with a turnover higher than US$5, 000,000per day.\\nText reprocessing removes stopwords, numbers, and less\\nmeaningful terms according to the TFxIDF measure. These\\npress releases are classiﬁed as \"Good News,\" \"Bad News,\"\\nand \"No Movers\" (for neutral news). Good news provokes a\\nrise of 3%on the stock price within at least 60minutes after\\nthe press release and increase the price average in at least\\n1%during this interval. Bad news provokes a drop of 3%\\nin the stock price within at least 60minutes after the press\\nrelease and decreases the price average in at least 1%during\\nthis interval. The other news is classiﬁed as \"No Movers.\"\\nAn SVM model was applied to predict stock prices using the\\nnews sentiment and historical price series. Results show a\\nrecall of approximately 60% and a better cumulative return\\nand average return per trade than the random trader in a stock\\nmarket simulation.\\n[83] analyzed 77,256 analysts reports from Thomson\\nFinancial Web service related to the companies in the Tokyo\\nStock Exchange from January 1, 2001 to March 31, 2003. 12\\nkeywords were extracted from the obtained reports’ title and\\nclassiﬁed into three classes: Good, Bad, and Neutral News.\\nChange of monthly consensus earnings estimate for the next\\n12 VOLUME 4, 2016'),\n",

The preprocessing step removed usernames and\\nlinks, identiﬁed occurrences of more than two letters in a\\nword and changed it to only one letter, drew explicit negation\\nwords, exclamation, and question marks, besides perform-\\ning text tokenization, removal of stopwords, stemming, N-\\ngram construction (size 2), and removed words that occurred\\nonly once. Two sentiment analysis models were applied.\\nThe ﬁrst classiﬁes the documents into two classes: negative\\nand positive, while the second classiﬁes them into three\\ncategories: negative, neutral, and positive. Sentiment analysis\\npresents an accuracy close to 80%. The study then analyzed a\\ncorrelation between 152,572 tweets discussing stock relevant\\ninformation about eight companies in nine months in 2011\\nand the stock closing prices of these eight companies for the\\nsame period. A statistical hypothesis test for stationary time\\nseries was performed to determine the linear correlation level\\nbetween the sentiment and stock closing price and whether\\none contains predictive information about the other (Granger\\ncausality analysis). Results indicate that tweets’ sentiment\\ncan predict stock price movements for several assets, and the\\nintroduced neutral class can improve the correlation between\\nthe opinionated tweets and the stock closing price in certain\\nsituations.\\n[48] examined a news archive from FINET, contain-\\ning both company-speciﬁc and market-related news from\\nJanuary 2003 to March 2008. The news was classiﬁed by\\nHarvard IV-4 sentiment dictionary (HVD), considering 15\\nsentiment dimensions, and Loughran–McDonald ﬁnancial\\nsentiment dictionary (LMD), considering six sentiment di-\\nmensions. An SVM model was developed to predict stock\\nmovement using historic daily open-to-close price return as\\na feature, in addition to the news sentiment moods values.\\nFor the SVM classiﬁcation, the stocks were labeled into\\nthree classes according to return value: positive, neutral, and\\nnegative. The paper concludes that sentiment analysis helps\\nto improve prediction accuracy.\\n[60] proposed different methods to classify untagged\\nmessages in ﬁve classes: Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell, and\\nStrong Sell. These messages were taken from 18 message\\nboards of the 18 stocks from Yahoo Finance Message Board\\nfor one year (July 23, 2012 to July 19, 2013). Historical\\ndaily adjusted close prices extracted from Yahoo Finance for\\n18 stocks were also used as features for a stock movement\\nprediction performed by an SVM algorithm, in which its\\nlabels represent actual price movement (up or down). Results\\nindicate that the incorporation of the sentiment analysis im-\\nproves the prediction accuracy.\\n[61] employed all tweets containing cashtags of all stocks\\ntraded in US stock markets from December 22, 2012 to\\nMarch 27, 2015, before the Stanford CoreNLP tool was\\napplied to execute common natural language processing\\nmethods, including tokenization, Part Of Speech (POS) tag-\\nging, and lemmatization.

A strong correlation\\nbetween them indicates that the microblogging sentiment\\nindicator can provide important information.\\n[62] collected a total of 2,50,000 tweets about Microsoft\\nfrom August 31, 2015 to August 25, 2016, extracted from\\nTwitter API, in addition to stock opening and closing prices\\nof Microsoft in the same period obtained from Yahoo! Fi-\\nnance. Tweet preprocessing included tokenization, stopwords\\nremoval, and regex matching for removing special characters.\\nSentiment analysis considered three different classes for each\\ntweet: positive, neutral, and negative. A total of 3,216 tweets\\nwere examined, labeled, then used to train a Random Forest\\nclassiﬁcation model. The trained model predicts other tweets’\\nsentiments. After performing sentiment analysis, a classiﬁca-\\ntion model used positive, neutral, and negative tweets in 3\\ndays as features to perform a binary stock movement clas-\\nsiﬁcation. Results show around 70% accuracy for sentiment\\nclassiﬁcation and around 70% accuracy for stock movement\\nprediction.\\n[5] retrieved around 300,000 tweets about Apple from\\nStockTwits during 2010-2017, each tweet composed by its\\ncontent, date, and user sentiment. Tweet preprocessing in-\\ncluded tokenization and removal of stopwords and Twitter\\nsymbols. An SVM model was trained for sentiment predic-\\ntion, in which daily sentiment is positive if there are more\\npositive tweets than negative ones and is negative if other-\\nwise. Besides, Apple’s historical price data were extracted\\nfrom Yahoo Finance from 2010 to 2017 and used for an\\nSVM classiﬁer that predicts binary class stock movement\\n(up or down). For sentiment prediction, the achieved test\\naccuracy was 63.5%, 75.3% recall, and 76.8% precision, and\\nfor stock movement prediction, the completed test accuracy\\nwas76.68%, 100% recall, and 69.5% precision.\\n[2] assigned daily sentiment scores for the DJIA market by\\naccumulating high-frequency sentiment scores of the DJIA’s\\nconstituents obtained from the TRNA dataset from January\\n2006 to October 2012.

Then, the daily\\nsentiment was computed as the average sentiment prediction\\nweighted by probabilities of each of these predictions to be\\ncorrected. The paper applied linear and quantile regression to\\nthese daily scores, analyzing its correlation with the Thom-\\nson Tick History database’s stock prices. The regressions\\nconsidered daily sentiments up to 5 days before a given\\nprice and that price.

The paper developed an ARIMA\\nmodel for price regression, considering only the stock price\\ndata. The Facebook Prophet algorithm was used to predict\\nfuture stock prices using historical closing prices. [56] also\\nproposed three Recurrent Neural Network Long Short Term\\nMemory (RNN LSTM) methods for stock price prediction.\\nThe ﬁrst method uses only the price data as features; the\\nsecond uses historical closing prices and the textual polarity\\n(negative or positive) for each asset provided by the natural\\nlanguage toolkit (NLTK); and the third uses the prices and\\ntextual data as features. The paper concludes that there is a\\nstrong relationship between stock prices and ﬁnancial news\\narticles, as the RNN LSTM models that use textual data\\nor sentiment information perform better than models that\\nuse only the prices data. [90] ﬁrst captured the semantic\\ninformation of stock-related tweets texts by applying LSTM\\nmodels that produce a textual representation for each set of\\ntexts about a particular asset on a given day. Subsequently,\\nanother LSTM model followed by a regression MLP was\\nused to predict future asset prices. [41] proposed using the\\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to extract\\nfeatures from the set of words formed by the text of each\\ntweet. The paper also presented the optimization of the\\ngenerated features using the Cuckoo Search (CS) Algorithm\\nand, ﬁnally, the classiﬁcation of the texts’ polarity (positive or\\nnegative) using a Neural Network algorithm. Results showed\\nthat this proposed approach surpasses previous approaches\\nfound in literature, considering the accuracy measure.\\n[70] proposed a Sentiment-aware volatility forecasting\\n(SA VING) method. The sentiment analysis considered social\\nmedia messages on StockTwits for 10 US stocks from August\\n14, 2017 to August 22, 2018. The work assessed the polarity\\nof feeling for a given asset taking into account the intensity\\nand quantity of messages about the asset. This polarity was\\ncoupled to the volatility prediction models as variables or\\nfeatures. For this, the paper used the Recurrent Neural Net-\\nwork (RNN) algorithm. The proposed SA VING model was\\ncompared with volatility prediction models that do not use\\nsentiment analysis: GARCH, EGARCH, TARCH, GJR, GP-\\nvol, VRNN, NSVM and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)\\nmodels. A t-test compared SA VING with each other method\\nand results indicate that SA VING statistically outperforms\\nall other methods, except EGARCH, TARCH and GJR, in\\naddition to not being dominated by any other method.\\nInformation about companies can be found on reported\\nnews, available on several websites, or comments and opin-\\nions given by social media users. Table 14 informs the data\\nsource used by each paper.\\nTable 15 speciﬁes how the papers attribute the sentiment\\nprediction for each ﬁnancial stock or index using texts about\\nits companies. Some works developed Machine Learning\\n(ML) models to predict the asset’s sentiment using texts\\ncollected from the news or social media comments. In con-\\ntrast, other papers utilized lexicon dictionaries that assign\\nsentiment values based on the collected texts. Other docu-\\nments employed data sets that contain the sentiment valueTABLE 14.

For this, some papers\\nanalyzed the correlation between the sentiment value for\\na given company and its stock price in the near future (a\\nfew days after the news or comment publication). Other\\npapers used these sentiment values to predict stock prices\\nor movement, intending to obtain proﬁts in stock market\\ntradings. Table 16 shows the application of the sentiment\\nanalysis by each paper.\\nIt is noted that the ﬁrst works on sentiment analysis applied\\nto ﬁnance use news as input data. However, there is a ten-\\ndency to use comments on social networks, which consider-\\nably increases this data’s total size. Thus, the pre-processing\\nof these data and selecting the most important terms becomes\\na necessary task in this approach. The sentiment analysis ap-\\nplied to ﬁnancial investments is commonly used, in practice,\\nto decide whether to buy or sell an asset under study and,\\ntherefore, is frequently combined with the historical analysis\\nof prices of these assets. In this combination, the predicted\\nsentiment is used as one of the Machine Learning algorithm\\nfeatures to predict the asset’s price or trend of movement.\\nVI. COMBINATIONS\\nCombination papers integrate two or more approaches dis-\\ncussed in this work, usually aiming to improve the perfor-\\nmance of a Machine Learning model or increase proﬁts pro-\\nvided by trading simulations in the stock market. Although\\nthe vast majority of papers used only one approach, many\\narticles indicate better combined methods, which are more\\nrecent works.\\n[27] used historical stock indicators and news to predict\\nstock market movements, analyzing 72 S&P 500 assets from\\n15 September 2006 to 31 August 2007, collecting historical\\nprices, trading volumes, best bid and ask prices, in addition\\nto 10 technical indicators.

For the classiﬁcation method, 30 at-\\ntributes were considered among different log-returns and\\ntechnical indicators obtained from daily data of 115 assets\\nthat participated in B3 between January 2004 and December\\n2016. For each day, t, assets that reach a minimum desired\\nreturn in the next day (t +1) are labeled as an up-trended asset\\nand the others as down-trended. The classiﬁcation algorithms\\nare SVMs with different hyperparameters values and a voting\\nensemble method considering all SVM classiﬁers. Portfolio\\noptimization considers the monobjective mean-CVaR model\\nwith variable cardinality constraint. The precision metric\\nwas selected to evaluate the classiﬁers, and results show\\nthat the combination of all classiﬁers does not exceed the\\nbest of the individual classiﬁers. From trading simulations,\\nthe paper concluded that the combination of ﬁnancial series\\nclassiﬁcation and portfolio optimization surpasses each of\\nthe single approaches, as statistical tests indicate better dailyreturns when using the proposed combination.\\n[71] combined sentiment analysis and network analysis\\nand tested the correlation between the network sentiment\\nand stock market prices. For this, tweets from three ofﬁcial\\ncertiﬁcated Twitter accounts (StockTwits, FinancialTimes,\\nand MarketWatch) were collected in a ﬁrst step. Then, tweets\\nfrom all the three groups’ followers were collected and\\ncombined into a single group or community. Tweets from\\nthis community were collected from January to September\\n2015, for 2,898,756 users and 775,928,121 tweets. In ad-\\ndition to this data set, another was formed by a trusted\\nnetwork, including tweets of users tagged by all followers\\nmentioned above. Both data sets were limited to tweets\\nrelated to the eight ﬁrms with the largest number of tweets,\\nconsidering both. After collecting these eight companies’\\nhistorical returns from 1 January 2015 to 31 August 2015,\\nlinear correlation methods were conducted.

For that, classiﬁcation models were\\nproposed and the sentiment information and the historical\\nreturns of each asset were used to assign a weight to each\\nasset. A classiﬁcation was performed for each asset and its\\nweight was determined by the normalization of the score\\nfunction predicted for each one. The paper employed 15\\ndifferent stocks from 24 January 2012 to 2 June 2017. Daily\\nﬁnancial data from the Quandl API and sentiment data from\\nthe StockFluence API were extracted. Results indicate that\\nusing sentiment analysis, together with ﬁnancial data, pro-\\nvides better portfolios than using only ﬁnancial data.\\n[67] combined sentiment analysis and stock movement\\nprediction based on historical prices and technical indicators.\\nSentiment analysis was applied on posts and documents of\\nthe 51 assets from the Sina stock forum and Eastmoney\\nstock forum between June 17, 2014 and June 7, 2016. Each\\nsentence of a paper was assigned to a polarity based on\\nHowNet and Chinese Sentiment Analysis Ontology Base.\\nDaily sentiment measure was computed based on the number\\nof negative and positive documents. This measure assumes a\\nvalue ranging from -1 to 1, where -1 is assigned to days with\\nonly negative papers and 1 to days with only positive docu-\\nments. The article also proposes an SVM binary classiﬁcation\\nmethod that predicts stock price movement (up or down) for\\nthe SSE 50 Index using eight features based on the sentiment\\nanalysis for each of the 51 assets, in addition to the historical\\nopening price, closing price, high for the day, low for the day,\\ntrading volume in the number of shares, trading volume in\\nRMB, change in RMB, and change in percentage data of the\\nIndex.

The\\nproposed model considers stock information, capital, stock\\nassets, and predicted stock trend as an environment for the\\nreinforcement learning model, while the agent’s actions are\\nbuying, selling, and holding assets. The trend prediction\\nwas made using a deep neural network composed of a\\nconvolutional layer and LSTM layer, which considers news\\n(represented by text embedding) and historical asset prices as\\nfeatures.\\nVII. CONCLUSION\\nThis paper consists of a systematic review of the literature\\non Artiﬁcial Intelligence applied to investments in the stock\\nmarket. Articles were selected from the Scopus website,\\nwhere documents with the highest number of citations were\\nconsidered most relevant. The papers were then divided intoportfolio optimization, stock market prediction using Artiﬁ-\\ncial Intelligence, ﬁnancial sentiment analysis, and combina-\\ntion papers involving two or more ﬁelds.\\nThe overview presents general information, such as the\\nmost cited papers in general and the most cited papers per\\nyear, which allows the identiﬁcation of periods of increased\\ninterest in Artiﬁcial Intelligence for investments, which,\\nunsurprisingly, coincides with signiﬁcant technological im-\\nprovement and popularization of the computer. Another es-\\nsential piece of information is the number of papers per\\nyear, which shows an exponential increase in the number of\\ndocuments from 1995 to 2019, indicating this to be a recent\\narea that has increasingly attracted research attention.\\nFor each area, primary (most-cited) papers for each year\\nwere analyzed, for the period between 1995 and 2019. Be-\\nsides, recent articles were found to include the state-of-the-\\nart ﬁndings for each area, in addition to indicating possible\\ndirections for future works. Tables were created for the appar-\\nent separation of the different characteristics of the methods\\nand models proposed in each paper.\\nFinally, the combinations of approaches presented in the\\npapers indicates superiority over single methods, although\\nthe number of combination papers in the literature is still\\nsmall.\\nA. CHALLENGES, GAPS AND FUTURE INSIGHTS\\nThe biggest challenge in reviewing the papers is the creation\\nof queries for Scopus that exclude irrelevant documents but,\\nat the same time, include the largest amount of relevant\\ndocuments possible. The second major difﬁculty is to analyze\\nthe large number of documents returned by the query. Thus,\\nthis work examines only the most essential documents (those\\nwith the highest number of citations). However, natural lan-\\nguage processing and data mining methods can be applied in\\nfuture works to analyze all returned papers.\\nFor the optimization of ﬁnancial portfolios, it is possible\\nto verify an increasing trend in using multiobjective models\\nand heuristic methods. Thus, models are becoming increas-\\ningly complex, and fast methods are desirable. However, the\\nnumber of papers that compare these more complex models\\nwith more basic monobjective models and exact methods\\nwith heuristics is still minimal.\\nRegarding forecasts using historical data of assets, Ma-\\nchine Learning methods are increasingly being used as of\\nrecent. Speciﬁcally, a signiﬁcant increase in Deep Learning\\nmethods, which has produced promising results. Meanwhile,\\nthere are wide variations in features used in different works,\\nincluding technical and fundamentalist indicators. Yet, lim-\\nited research has been conducted to analyze each of these\\nfeature’s contribution to the performance of the methods.\\nThe ﬁrst works on sentiments analysis applied to ﬁnancial\\ninvestment employed the news as the object of study. Due\\nto the popularization of social networks, a large number of\\ncomments about ﬁnancial assets and their companies are\\navailable on the Internet, which is becoming the most used\\nsource of information in this type of analysis. However, very\\n18 VOLUME 4, 2016'),\n",
